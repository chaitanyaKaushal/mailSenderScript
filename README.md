A python script to send mails from your gmail, outlook or other mail services.

While running the script for gmail services, you need to keep in mind two points:-
a) if you have 2-step verification enabled and you do not want to disable it, then you should :
i) go to your Google Account -> Signing in to Google -> App Passwords -> select the app and device you want to allow -> click generate.
ii) do the next needful things
b) disable the 2 step verification, then go to
i) google account -> security -> less secure apps -> give the allowance

Run your script and you are good to go !
